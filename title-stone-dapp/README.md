## 🎯 Features

- **Land Title Registration**

  - Users can connect their wallet and register a new land title (owner name, location, area) on-chain.

- **Lookup / Search**

  - Search by Title ID or by owner wallet address.

- **Transfer Ownership**

  - Transfer registered titles to new owners securely.

- **Digital Notary**

  - Upload notarized document URLs linked to a land ID.

- **Notarized Records**

  - View live notarized documents with verification and community voting.

- **Sell & Lease Modules**

  - List land titles for sale or lease, manage and track availability and pricing.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

1. **Smart Contracts** (Solidity)

   - Manage land titles (`id`, `owner`, `ownerName`, `location`, `squareMeters`).
   - Ownership transfer events.
   - Notary logic for adding and validating document URLs.
   - Listing functionality for sale and lease with pricing and duration.

2. **Front-End**

   - Static HTML + Tailwind CSS + Ethers.js for mobile-responsive UI.
   - Pages:

     - _Dashboard_ – Overview stats and registered titles.
     - _Register, Search, Transfer, Notary, Notary‑Records, Sell, Lease_ interfaces.

   - Web3 wallet integration with account handling (connect/disconnect, network/account change listeners).

3. **Contract Module**

   - Shared `contract.js` exports ABI, deployed contract address, utility functions (`getAllLands()`, `getContract()`, etc.).
